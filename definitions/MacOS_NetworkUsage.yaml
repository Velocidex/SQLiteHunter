Name: MacOS NetworkUsage

Description: |
   On macOS, the NetUsage DB can provide various details around
   application network utilization. With this artifact, we can get an
   idea of what applications are utilizing the network for
   communications and to what degree. We can also identify if usage
   has occurred through a WIFI network or a wired network.
