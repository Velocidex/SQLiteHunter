Name: MacOS Applications Cache
Author: Wes Lambert - @therealwlambert
Description: |
  Applications can use the NSURL cache to store specific data that is
  useful to the operation of the application in a `Cache.db` file on
  disk. The data contained within this file could potentially be
  useful to investigators or incident responders, such as URLs that
  were accessed, as well as data requested or returned.
