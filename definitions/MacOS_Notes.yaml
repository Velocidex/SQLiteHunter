Name: MacOS Notes
Author: Wes Lambert - @therealwlambert
Description: |
   This artifact provides details about notes taken using the default
   Notes application on macOS.  These notes can be useful during an
   investigation, especially if tied to interesting files.

   Deleted notes and attachments can also be recovered in some
   instances.

   The SQL query within this artifact was primarily derived from
   Yogesh Khatri's referenced blog post.

   NOTE: This artifact may not cover all attachments at this time, and
   there are many more great pieces of data to discover! More
   information can be found in the `ZICCLOUDSYNCINGOBJECT` table.
