# The Velociraptor SQLiteHunter Site

This repository maintains the source for the
Generic.Forensic.SQLiteHunter VQL artifact. This artifact is designed
to be an efficient and mostly automated artifact to analyze and
collect SQLite based artifacts from various applications on the
endpoint.

The produced artifact is self contained and can be loaded into
Velociraptor (https://docs.velociraptor.app) to hunt quickly and
efficiently across a large number of endpoints.
